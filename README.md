# FFL
Decompilation of Wii U Face Library v1.3.10, used in New Super Mario Bros. U v1.3.0.  

FFL is a library that is part of nn (**N**intendo SDK C++ API **N**amespace?), used for dealing with Mii data.  
While most of nn is already open to developers as part of the Cafe SDK by Nintendo, FFL is a closed-source library that is sent to developers on demand.  

This decompilation aims to provide more information on Mii data, as well as to further push the progress on the [New Super Mario Bros. U decompilation project](https://github.com/aboood40091/red-pro2).  

See [Sead](https://github.com/aboood40091/sead) for matching policy.
